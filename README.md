## :video_game: The Project

Won Games is a PC games e-commerce platform built with the goal of applying advanced front-end development concepts, unit testing (with and without TDD), end-to-end testing, continuous integration, and delivery in a production environment.

The e-commerce platform consists of two applications:

- **wongames-client** (code available in this repository): the user interface for customers, built with Next.js.
- **wongames-api** (available in this other [repository](https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-api)): the service responsible for providing data. It was built with Strapi, a headless CMS, which in addition to acting as the back-end of the client application, also offers a user interface for the e-commerce administrator.


## :bulb: Features

#### :mag: Explore Games
- The store features a page that was developed to allow users to explore games conveniently, using filters for price, genre, and platform.

## :arrows_counterclockwise: Continuous Integration

To automatically identify code problems on a regular basis (with each new set of changes incorporated) a continuous integration solution has been implemented to ensure higher software quality for the project. GitHub Actions has been employed for this purpose, actively detecting new modifications and triggering end-to-end tests automatically.

When a new change request is created in the wongames-client repository, a Github action is initiated, building an end-to-end testing environment from Docker images. These images are automatically generated for each commit to the [wongames-api](https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-api) and [wongames-database](https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-database) repositories.

The [wongames-database](https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-database) repository is used to generate a Docker image containing a PostgreSQL database that is already populated with specific data that will be used in the end-to-end tests.

Example of a Pull Request with end-to-end verification: [PR](https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-client/pull/78)

</div>

## :test_tube: UI Components Playground

In addition to the application, a UI components playground (which also serves as documentation), was built with Storybook. This tool can be really handy for front-end development teams, and it can even help non-technical individuals to envision new features. It helps provide a user-friendly interface to interact with components, ensuring a more intuitive understanding of their functionalities and variations. The advantages of using Storybook include consistency and maintainability throughout the development lifecycle.

## üèóÔ∏è The Development Process

The construction of this project was part of a very well-structured [course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-avancado) that provided a solid foundation for application development. However, the course was released in 2020, and its support was discontinued before I had the availability to resume it. This required me to put in additional effort to investigate and resolve technical challenges that were not covered in the lessons, such as managing dependency versions, TypeScript errors, Docker image generation, and setting up the local development environment.

To overcome these technical challenges, I adopted an investigative problem-solving approach, delving deep into the technologies used, reviewing official documentation, and exploring online communities. I feel that this not only strengthened my problem-solving skills but also contributed to a deeper understanding of the tools and technologies involved in the project.

Overall, the development of this project was a rewarding experience. I learned a lot about front-end development, testing, and continuous integration. I also had the opportunity to make use of and enhance my skills and experience as a software engineer, which I have been building over the years.

## :computer: How to run

The recommended Node.js version to use in this project is specified in the `.nvmrc` file, at the root directory.

> [!NOTE]
> By installing and using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) you can automatically change to the version specified in `.nvmrc`. Just run the following command:
> ```
> nvm use
> ```


Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Matheuslm10/wongames-client.git
```

Enter the directory:
```
cd wongames-client
```

Install the dependencies:
```
yarn install
```

Run the application:
```
yarn dev
```

Now you can access `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

### Other Commands:
- `yarn build`: creates the production build version.
- `yarn start`: starts a simple server with the build production code.
- `yarn lint`: runs the linter in all components and pages.
- `yarn test`: runs jest to test all components and pages.
- `yarn test:watch`: runs jest in watch mode.
- `yarn storybook`: runs storybook on localhost:6006.
- `yarn build-storybook`: create the build version of storybook.

### E2E Tests:

**Requirements**: [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

Once you're at `wongames-client` directory, enter the following:
```
cd cypress
```

Compose the E2E tests environment:
```
docker-compose up
```

Run the tests:
```
yarn test:e2e
```
